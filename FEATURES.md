#### Story Changes:
- The National Pokédex is available as soon as the player becomes the Champion without first registering 60 Pokémon in the Pokédex or first visiting the Sevii Islands.
- Event tickets are given away through gameplay milestones, allowing the player access to Birth Island and Navel Rock to catch Deoxys and Ho-oh/Lugia, respectively. []
	* Faraway Island has been ported from Emerald, allowing players to catch Mew. The Old Sea Map is given away similarly to the other event tickets.
		* This Mew counts as an Emerald Faraway Island Mew for legality purposes.
- Expanded postgame, focusing on giving the Sevii Islands more content. []
	* The Sevii Islands are now exclusively a postgame area and cannot be accessed until becoming the Champion. []
	* Expanded Sevii Islands story and new routes added. []

#### Quality of Life Changes:
- No link restrictions
	* Trade with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, and XD the moment that the player catches a second Pokémon.
		* Unmodified Emerald may need the National Dex before it allows trading.
- No evolution restrictions; Pokémon will evolve regardless of whether or not their evolution is in the Kanto Dex.
- Cut Trees stay cut permanently.
- Infinite TM usage. TM prices have been modified to reflect this.
- Expanded item pockets. []
- Move Tutors will charge after the first time they teach a move, allowing infinite tutor uses at a cost. Frenzy Plant, Blast Burn, and Hydro Cannon can be tutored infinitely for free, and no longer have a friendship requirement to learn.
- Hold B while surfing to go faster.
- Running indoors.
- Toggle auto running with the R button.
- Instant text option.
- Indicators for which stats are affected by natures on summary screen.
- Health bar drains faster at higher HP levels.
- EV-reducing berries ported from Emerald (the Pomeg glitch was fixed during the port).
- The EV cap for an individual stat is 252, like in later generations.

#### Miscellaneous Changes
- The Pokémon Summary Screen can accurately show the met location of any Pokémon obtained in Gen 3, including Pokémon from Orre.
- All Deoxys formes are included, and are implemented in the way that the GBA games did it for link compatibility purposes. Switch Deoxys' forme by examining the meteorite exhibit in the Pewter Museum of Science.
- Version exclusives are available through regular gameplay. []
	* All Kanto Pokémon, along with select Johto Pokémon (in the Sevii Islands), will be available in one playthrough. Most Hoenn Pokémon will still need to be traded for. []
- Abilities have effects in the overworld ported from Emerald.
- LGPE-style bonus Premier Balls in shops. Buying multiples of ten of any Poké Ball type will give bonus Premier Balls.
